## In Short
A simple C# repo, containing [several scenarios](https://github.com/hanssens/WhatIsFaster/tree/master/source/WhatIsFaster/Scenarios) to see which coding variant performs better. 

The scenarios are:

**[Scenario - Populating Collections](https://github.com/hanssens/WhatIsFaster/blob/master/source/WhatIsFaster/Scenarios/WhenPopulatingCollections.cs)**  
How do these collections perform when adding a lots of records; array[], List<T> or ConcurrentBag<T>?

**[Scenario - Populating Collections (Parallel)](https://github.com/hanssens/WhatIsFaster/blob/master/source/WhatIsFaster/Scenarios/PopulatingCollectionsParallel.cs)**  
Identical to 'Populating Collections', only now in parallel.
